# 17_Top_Tier_Wuhan-Hu-1_siRNA
An RNAi pipeline is applied to the genome of SARS like corona virus Wuhan-HU-1 yielding 17 candidate siRNA sequences for nebulization tests

# Methods
1) Generated all 21mers for the human genome transcriptome gencodev33 and the Wuhan-Hu-1 coronavirus (WH1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512) 
2) Found all 21mers that were in the WH1 genome and not the human transcriptome
3) filtered the remaining 29854 21mers into those that did not contain 5,4,3, or 2 stretches of bases (n=27951,22303,9351,123 resp.)
4) Proceeded with the n=123 21mers to back compare against the entire NT database for 
4.1) circular top hits back to a coronavirus and 4.2) with a complete 21 bp alignment.
5) Of the 17 nucleotide aligned candidates left, put the sequences through a thermodynamic nearest neighbor analysis 
5.1) generate the free energy of binding difference between the virus, and human transcriptome and genome (not released here yet)
6) inspect the distribution of target sites on the annotated Wuhan-Hu-1 genome for the targeting sites (WH1.png)

So these siRNA are now available for clinical research testing against cases of Wuhan-Hu-1 that are not responding to vaccines or other therapy.
